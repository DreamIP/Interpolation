# Interpolation
In this repository, we provide a hardware implementation of a set of algorithms proposed as alternatives to bi-cubic interpolation.

The architecture of each algorithm is detailed in [1]. If you find this implementation useful, please cite the reference [1]. Also, make sure to adhere to the licensing terms of the authors.
